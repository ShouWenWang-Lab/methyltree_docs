# MethylTree

This document is for MethylTree, a tool that infers lineage from sparse single-cell DNA methylation data.


![Example for input data structure in Methyltree](images/data_format.png)



## Input Overview

The input consists of the following files:

-  `data.tsv.gz`: this data file contains the methylation rate for each selected genomic region of each cell, with three columns in total (`cell_id`, `genomic_region_id`, `value`). This is the long-format pandas table of the cell-by-region methylation matrix.
- `sample_info.tsv.gz`: this metadata file describes various parameters for each cell sample, with at least three columns(`sample`, `HQ`, `Clone_key`). The field `sample` is identical to the field of `cell_id` in `data.tsv.gz`.

#### `data.tsv.gz`

| **Column**          | **Required** | **Type** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cell_id`           | ✔️             | `str`    | the name of each cell                                 |
| `genomic_region_id` | ✔️             | `str`    | the name of a selected genomic region on the cell            |
| `value`             | ✔️             | `float`  | methylation rate in the specified genomic region of the cell. Values are percentages without % |

Website will not automatically merge regions (`ED Fig.1 c`). If need to merge regions, please do so before generating this file.

#### `sample_info.tsv.gz`

| **Column**     | **Required** | **Type** | **Description**                                              |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sample`       | ✔️             | `str`    | the name of each cell, identical to `cell_id` in `data.tsv.gz`. |
| `HQ`           | ✔️             | `bool`   | the scBS-seq quality control status for each cell. Cells that pass quality control are marked as True. Only these cells will be used for lineage reconstruction. |
| `Clone_key`    | ✔️             | `str`    | the true lineage information for each cell. This information is not needed for running MethylTree. However, we use it as a placeholder for visualization. Lineage reconstruction accuracy will be computed based on this information. If the actuall lineage information is not available, you can replace it with other cell information that you are interested for visualization.|
| `Celltype_key` |               | `str`    | the cell type information for each cell. DNA methylation is known to also modulate cell types. If the user's data include multiple cell types, they may wish to remove this confounding factor to more accurately infer lineage histories. If so, this column is necessary. |

Users can add more columns as needed. These additional columns can be displayed in the color bar of the final heatmap.

### MethylTree Configuration

In this step, the user needs to select suitable columns from the `sample_info.tsv.gz` to use `MethylTree` for analysis.

| **Section** | **Required?** | **Description**                                              |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Basic`     | ✔️             | select a column from the `sample_info.tsv.gz` as the `Column for clone ID` for `MethylTree` analysis. |
| `Features`  |               | if select `Remove cell type signal`, then select a column from the `sample_info.tsv.gz` as the `Column for cell type` to remove the cell type information during `MethylTree` analysis. |
| `Figures`   |               | select a column from the `sample_info.tsv.gz` as the `additional column` to be additionally displayed in the colorbar of the heatmap. |

## Output Overview

The output is a `.zip` file. It contains all the dataset information, including `the input details`, `the heatmap of cell-cell similarity matrix`, `the reconstructed lineage tree`, and `the accuracy of the reconstructed lineage tree`.  The final accuracy is measured based on the `Column for clone ID` in the `Basic` selection of the `Configure` section. The heatmap will also use this column by default to display the color bar.

- `result.h5ad`: This is the core result file, which can be read as an `adata` file, including all the dataset information.
- `lineage_tree.txt`: A lineage tree reconstructed using the `UPGMA` algorithm based on the similarity matrix calculated by `MethylTree`.
- `lineage_order.npy`: The sequential clone information of the leaf nodes in the reconstructed lineage tree.
- `state_clone_info.csv`: The index and clone_ID of each cell.
- `accuracy_at_varying_threshold.csv`: Describes how changes in similarity thresholds affect clone identification accuracy.
- `accuracy.csv`: By analyzing the leaf nodes of the reconstructed lineage tree, a sorted sequence of cells is obtained (`lineage_order`). Various metrics (`accuracy`, `continuity`, `entropy`, and `Wasserstein distance`) are used to evaluate the performance of `each clone` in this sequence. Additionally, the ordered sequence of cells are randomly shuffling and the corresponding accuracy is also computed on this randomized data.
- `stats.txt`: It calculates the weighted average and arithmetic average of `accuracy`, `continuity`, `entropy`, and `wasserstein distance` for all clones. 
- `accuracy_by_depth.pdf`: Visualizing how the accuracy of reconstructing the original clones and the number of identified clones change with the depth of the reconstructed phylogenetic tree.
- `memory_pvalue.pdf`: Shows the distribution of similarity scores within each clone or for randomized clones and calculates the overall `p-value` to evaluate the significance of within-clone methylation similarity.
- `pvalue_for_individual_clone.pdf`: Displays the `p-value` for each clone to evaluate wether the within-clone methylation similarity is statistically significant compared to the randomized background.
- `similarity_matrix_multiple_colorbars.pdf`: Visualization of the calculated cell-to-cell methylation similarity matrix.
